# Virtual Vending Machine

For each type of soft drink, the information is composed of the name of the soft drink, followed by the price, and the number of stocks, all separated by space.

### 4 main functions

â€¢ It accepts a coin only. It reports the value of the inserted coin and the total amount of coin currently have.
##### 2. Reject
It rejects all the coins. It reports values of coin rejected in accending order and the total amount of coin rejected.
